%analyze whether or not the opening operation has improved the image processing algorithm by plotting the row sum
S = sum(BWstripes, 2)
plot(S)

%The improvement becomes more noticeable if original row sum signal is plotted alongside the opened image row sum.

hold on
plot(Sbw)
hold off

%opening operation has increased the valley depths in the plot. Hence it has helped.
