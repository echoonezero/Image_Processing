%To perform background subtraction, you must first define a neighbothood. You can use the ones function to create a square neighborhood
nhood = ones(30)	% use nhood = strel("disk",25) and see the changes

%imtophat function removes uneven background illumination when the background is darker than the foreground. This does both the background estimation and subtraction

%When the background is bright, you need to even out variation in bright intensities. Use imbothat to subtract the image from its bright background.
